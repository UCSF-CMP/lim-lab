					h2 How Do Cells Make Decisions?
					h3 Probing &amp; Programming Cell Signaling Circuits
					.col.s12.m8.l7
						p Living cells use genetically encoded molecular networks to monitor their environment and make sophisticated decisions.   We are interested in understanding the design principles underlying the function and evolution of these networks.  Cellular networks are interconnected and multifunctional; disentangling them to elucidate mechanisms is challenging. Thus, in addition to deconstructing natural networks, we use synthetic biology approaches to construct or rewire networks in ways that allow us to systematically analyze them.  We study diverse cell types (yeast, T cells, neurons) to elucidate the general logic that cells use to solve common regulatory problems. As we better understand the design rules of cellular networks, we have become interested in applying this knowledge to engineer designer cells that carry out therapeutic functions, such as sensing and destroying cancer.
						p Our lab is composed of outstanding scientists from diverse fields (biochemistry, structural biology, cell biology, immunology, systems/synthetic biology, neurobiology, dev. biology, engineering, physics, chemistry) who are interested in applying interdisciplinary approaches to cutting edge problems in an exciting, collaborative environment.

								.collapsible-body
									p Can we reconstitute signaling pathways and networks to uncover their mechanisms of signal transmission, specificity and information processing?  We reconstitute systems both in vitro (biochemical reconstitution), as well as in vivo using heterologous engineered cellular systems (synthetic reconstitution).
									p Reconstitution allows us to systematically and surgically vary individual system parameters to map precisely how these parameters contribute to system function and fitness. Tools such as optogenetics give us dials and knobs with which we can precisely perturb these complex systems in living cells.

									h5 Collective Decisions &amp; Self-organization
								.collapsible-body
									p Most cells make important decisions through a combination of both autonomous (individual cell) responses and collective responses, mediated by secretion-based cell-cell communication (e.g. autocrine, paracrine, quorum sensing).  
									p Currently, it is extremely challenging to distinguish autonomous and collective responses. We are using synthetic signaling systems and orthogonal cell-cell communication systems to disentangle these circuits.  We hope to determine common ways in which cell-cell signaling can process and reshape autonomous responses.
									p We are also trying to understand how cell-cell communication network motifs contribute to emergent multicellular spatial self-organization in processes such as development.

									p We are applying our knowledge of signaling networks to engineer cells with custom therapeutic responses. We are focusing on engineering T cells, as T cells armed with synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have proven to be a highly effective clinical platform for recognizing and killing cancer cells. We are designing next generation therapeutic cells that are safer yet more potent by detecting and integrating multiple control inputs.  We have received an NIH Director’s Transformative RO1 grant for this project.  We are also interested in engineering therapeutic cells for autoimmunity, infectious disease, and regenerative medicine.

									.note Using Time to Encode Information
								.collapsible-body
									p Time is an underappreciated element in biological regulation. The dynamics of inputs (duration, frequency) can be as important as dose in controlling the magnitude and specificity of cellular responses.  We are using optogenetic and microfluidic approaches to interrogate the mechanisms of dynamically regulated signaling circuits.  We are also using computational and synthetic biology approaches to construct circuits that are gated by temporally encoded information.

					h4 Science Education &amp; Outreach
					p The Lim Lab is strongly committed to innovation in science education and outreach.  We host the UCSF-Lincoln High School iGEM team, a long standing partnership between UCSF and the San Francisco Unified School District Biotechnology Program.  Wendell has also co-authored an innovative textbook on Cell Signaling, published by Garland Science.  The Lim Lab has also participated in a collaboration with the design consultancy, IDEO, to explore the role of design thinking in biological research and synthetic biology.  We are also collaborating with the Harvard laboratory of Self-Organizing Systems to use kilobots (simple collective robot swarms) as a tool to simulate and teach about molecular and cellular collective systems.
