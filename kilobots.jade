			p Kilobots are simple low cost robots capable of only elementary sensing and movement. But because they can communicate with one another, they can execute complex self-organization as a swarm. They were developed by Radhika Nagpalâ€™s lab at Harvard University.

					p We held a kilobot workshop at UCSF that brought together molecular &amp; cell biologists from UCSF with roboticists from Harvard.  We explored how kilobots could be used to simulate cellular scale self-organizational processes.  We now have a 100-kilobot swarm here at UCSF.
					p We are interested in using kilobots as an educational tool for physically simulating collective molecular and cellular behaviors.
