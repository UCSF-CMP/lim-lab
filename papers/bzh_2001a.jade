	|   <p class="abstract">PDZ domains are protein-protein 
	|     interaction modules that organize intracellular signaling complexes. Most 
	|     PDZ domains recognize specific peptide motifs followed by a required COOH-terminus. 
	|     However, several PDZ domains have been found which recognize specific internal 
	|     peptide motifs. The best characterized example is the syntrophin PDZ domain 
	|     which, in addition to binding peptide ligands with the consensus sequence 
	|     -E-S/T-X-V-COOH, also binds the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) PDZ 
	|     domain in a manner that does not depend on its precise COOH-terminal sequence. 
	|     In the structure of the syntrophin-nNOS PDZ heterodimer complex, the two PDZ 
	|     domains interact in a head-to-tail fashion, with an internal sequence from 
	|     the nNOS PDZ domain binding precisely at the peptide binding groove of the 
	|     syntrophin PDZ domain. To understand the energetic basis of this alternative 
	|     mode of PDZ recognition, we have undertaken an extensive mutagenic and biophysical 
	|     analysis of the nNOS PDZ domain and its interaction with the syntrophin PDZ 
	|     domain. Our data indicate that the presentation of the nNOS internal motif 
	|     within the context of a rigid beta-hairpin conformation is absolutely essential 
	|     to binding; amino acids crucial to the structural integrity of the hairpin 
	|     are as important or more important than residues that make direct contacts. 
	|     The results reveal the general rules of PDZ recognition of diverse ligand 
	|     types. </p>
