	|   <p class="abstract">Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) activates the actin regulatory
	|     protein N-WASP by binding to a short polybasic region involved in N-WASP
	|     autoinhibition. Here, we show that unlike canonical lipid binding modules,
	|     such as PH domains, this polybasic motif binds PIP2 in a multivalent, cooperative
	|     manner. As a result, PIP2 activation of N-WASP-mediated actin polymerization
	|     in vitro and in extracts is ultrasensitive: above a certain threshold, N-WASP
	|     responds in a switch-like manner to a small increase in the density of PIP2
	|     (Hill coefficient nH = ~20). We show that the sharpness of the PIP2 activation
	|     threshold can be tuned by varying the length of the polybasic motif. This
	|     sharp activation threshold may help suppress N-WASP activation by quiescent
	|     PIP2 levels yet leave it poised for activation upon subtle, signaling-induced
	|   perturbations in PIP2 distribution.</p>
