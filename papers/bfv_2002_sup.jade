	|     (A) In addition to the covalently linked construct used for the bulk of these 
	|     studies, we also generated a construct containing a thrombin cleavage site 
	|     between the WIP peptide and the EVH1 domain. Samples were prepared and the 
	|     second construct cleaved to completion as described in Experimental Procedures.

	|     (B) 2D 15N-1H HSQC spectra of the covalently tethered complex (black) and 
	|     the cleaved complex (red). Bottom image shows an overlay of the two spectra. 
	|     In all images EVH1 domain residues at the binding surface are labeled in violet 
	|     and WIP peptide residues are labeled in gold. Labeled EVH1 residues include 
	|     those that that bind the N-terminal part of the peptide (Y46, W56, F104, T106; 
	|     see Figure 5) and those that bind near the C terminus of the peptide (E90, 
	|     Y92, G109, C112). Visible peptide residues range from 461 to 480. The spectra 
	|     are virtually identical except for minor shifts (green) at residues near the 
	|     cleavage termini. A few new resonances in the cleaved spectrum correspond 
	|     to the new residues introduced by the thrombin site. <br>
	|     <br>
	|     Conclusion: the structure of the EVH1-WIP complex remains the same even after 
	|     cleavage of the covalent tether.
