	|   <p class="abstract">The protein N-WASP [a 
	|     homolog to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)] regulates actin polymerization 
	|     by stimulating the actin-nucleating activity of the actin-related protein 
	|     2/3 (Arp2/3) complex. N-WASP is tightly regulated by multiple signals: Only 
	|     costimulation by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) 
	|     yields potent polymerization. We found that regulation requires N-WASP's constitutively 
	|     active output domain (VCA) and two regulatory domains: a Cdc42-binding domain 
	|     and a previously undescribed PIP(2)-binding domain. In the absence of stimuli, 
	|     the regulatory modules together hold the VCA-Arp2/3 complex in an inactive 
	|     &quot;closed&quot; conformation. In this state, both the Cdc42- and PIP2-binding 
	|     sites are masked. Binding of either input destabilizes the closed state and 
	|     enhances binding of the other input. This cooperative activation mechanism 
	|     shows how combinations of simple binding domains can be used to integrate 
	|     and amplify coincident signals.</p>
