	|   <p class="abstract">PDZ domains
	|       are protein-protein interaction modules that normally recognize short C-terminal
	|       peptides. The apparent requirement for a ligand with a free terminal carboxylate
	|     group has led to the proposal that electrostatic interactions with the terminus
	|       play a significant
	|     role in recognition. However, this model has been called into question by
	|       the more recent finding that PDZ domains can recognize some internal peptide
	|       motifs that occur within a specific secondary structure context. Although
	|       these motifs bind at the same interface, they lack a terminal charge. Here
	|       we have investigated the role of electrostatics in PDZ-mediated recognition
	|       in the mouse <font face="Symbol">a</font>1-syntrophin PDZ domain by examining the salt dependence
	|       of binding to both terminal and internal ligands and the effects of mutating
	|       a conserved basic residue previously proposed to play a role in electrostatic
	|       recognition.
	|     These studies indicate that direct electrostatic interactions with the peptide
	|       terminus do not play a significant energetic role in binding. Additional
	|       chemical modification studies of the peptide terminus support a model in
	|       which steric and hydrogen bonding complementarity play a primary role in
	|       recognition specificity. Peptides with a free carboxy terminus, or presented
	|       within a specific structural context, can satisfy these requirements. </p>
