	|   <p class="abstract">Living cells rival computers in their ability to process external information
	|     and make complex behavioral decisions. Many of these decisions are made by
	|     networks of interacting signaling proteins. Ongoing structural, biochemical
	|     and cell-based studies have begun to reveal several common principles by
	|     which protein components are used to specifically transmit and process information.
	|     Recent engineering studies demonstrate that these relatively simple principles
	|     can be used to rewire signaling behavior in a process that mimics the evolution
	|   of new phenotypic responses. </p>
