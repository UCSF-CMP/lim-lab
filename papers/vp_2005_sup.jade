	| Movies were made from timelapse images taken every 5 s over a time period of
	| 5&ndash;10 min. Live cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy under 600&times; magnification
	| 24 hr after transfection with the appropriate constructs (N-WASP variant and
	| actin-GFP). Supplemental Movie 1 depicts a cell transfected with 14K N-WASP and
	| actin-GFP. Actin comet tails can be seen rocketing around the cytoplasm. For
	| comparison, Supplemental Movie 2 depicts an example of a cell transfected with
	| 9K N-WASP and actin-GFP. No actin rocketing is observed. Only slight fluctuations
	| of vacuoles are observed. Played with Windows Media Player, these movies run
	| 15 s (14 K) and 8 s (9 K) each. The movies have been accelerated by a factor
	| of approximately 35-fold above real time. See Experimental Procedures for further
	| details.
