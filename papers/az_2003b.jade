	|   <p class="abstract">Most proteins that participate
	|       in cellular signalling networks contain modular protein-interaction domains.
	|       Multiple versions of such domains are present
	|     within a given organism: the yeast proteome, for example, contains 27 different
	|     Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. This raises the potential problem of cross-reaction.
	|     It is generally thought that isolated domain&#8211;ligand pairs lack sufficient
	|     information to encode biologically unique interactions, and that specificity
	|     is instead encoded by the context in which the interaction pairs are presented.
	|     Here we show that an isolated peptide ligand from the yeast protein Pbs2
	|     recognizes its biological partner, the SH3 domain from Sho1, with near-absolute
	|     specificity&#8212;no other SH3 domain present in the yeast genome cross-reacts
	|     with the Pbs2 peptide, in vivo or in vitro. Such high specificity, however,
	|     is not observed in a set of non-yeast SH3 domains, and Pbs2 motif variants
	|     that cross-react with other SH3 domains confer a fitness defect, indicating
	|     that the Pbs2 motif might have been optimized to minimize interaction with
	|     competing domains specifically found in yeast. System-wide negative selection
	|     is a subtle but powerful evolutionary mechanism to optimize specificity within
	|   an interaction network composed of overlapping recognition elements </p>
