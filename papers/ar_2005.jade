	|   <p class="abstract">Cells use a network of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) to coordinate
	|     responses to diverse extracellular signals. Here, we examine the role of
	|     docking interactions in determining connectivity of the yeast MAPKs Fus3
	|     and Kss1. These closely related kinases are activated by the common upstream
	|     MAPK kinase Ste7 yet generate distinct output responses, mating and filamentous
	|     growth, respectively. We find that docking interactions are necessary for
	|     communication with the kinases and that they can encode subtle differences
	|     in pathway-specific input and output. The cell cycle arrest mediator Far1,
	|     a mating-specific substrate, has a docking motif that selectively binds Fus3.
	|     In contrast, the shared partner Ste7 has a promiscuous motif that binds both
	|     Fus3 and Kss1. Structural analysis reveals that Fus3 interacts with specific
	|     and promiscuous peptides in conformationally distinct modes. Induced fit
	|     recognition may allow docking peptides to achieve discrimination by exploiting
	|   subtle differences in kinase flexibility. </p>
